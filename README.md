## A top-down view of the center of the Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone
The central 300 pc of the Milky Way, the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), has extreme physical properties not found elsewhere in our Galaxy. A comprehensive 3-D model of the central 300 pc of the (CMZ) is fundamentally important to understanding energy cycles in galactic nuclei, and answering questions across multiple fields of astrophysics: e.g. how processes such as star formation vary with environment, constraining limits on dark matter annihilation and diffuse gamma ray emission from Fermi Space Telescope measurements, and helping to place our galaxy in the context of the local universe. **We present a series of papers and data products, providing detailed analysis of the Milky Way's CMZ for a comprehensive top-down model of the CMZ.**
